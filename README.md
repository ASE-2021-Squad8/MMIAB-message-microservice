## Instructions
### Initialization
Set up a virtual environment in your preferred way, then install the dependencies.
As an example:
```
python -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

### Run the project

Simply run the `run.sh` script.

#### Application Environments

The available environments are:

- debug
- development
- testing
- production

The `run.sh` script defaults to a development environment.

**Note:** if you use `docker-compose up` you are going to startup a production ready microservice, hence postgres will be used as default database and gunicorn will serve your application.

### Run tests

To run all the tests, execute the following command:

`python -m pytest -v`

You can also specify one or more specific test files, in order to run only those specific tests.
In case you also want to see the overall coverage of the tests, execute the following command:

`python -m pytest -v --cov-report term-missing`
